### Welcome to Jota's beautiful GitHub account.

In my ID documents my name is JoÃ£o Francisco, however ever since I'm a baby I've been Jota (which is the tenth letter of the alphabet in portuguese), so call me Jota. I'm from Brasil, and a bachelor student of electrical engineering at @USP. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects for learning and also on some neat ideas for automation of administrative tasks for the Electric FSAE team @EESC-USP-TUPA which I am a member.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Python which is the language I'm most proficient and a few Python related subjects such as Pandas and Jupyter notebooks. I'm also studying some other languages such as C++, and Javascript. I haven't been the best at keeping this GitHub account updated, however that will happen with future projects from now on.
