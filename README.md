### Welcome to Jota's beautiful GitHub account.

In my ID documents my name is JoÃ£o Francisco, however ever since I'm a toddler I've been Jota (which is the tenth letter of the alphabet in portuguese), so call me Jota. I'm from Brasil, and a bachelor student of electrical engineering at @USP. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects for learning and also on some neat ideas for automation of administrative tasks for the Electric FSAE team @EESC-USP-TUPA which I am a member.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some very basic Python and several Python related subjects such as Pandas and Jupyter notebooks. I'm also interested to take a shot at other languages such as C++, Java, or Javascript, in the very near future.
